#### **Elbow Method**
1. Enter the values of **X** and **Y** in the attributes section and click on the **ADD** button.
2. Repeat step 1 until there are **5** data-points in the table.
3. Click on the **NEXT** button.
4. Select centroids and click on the **SUBMIT** button.
5. Find the Euclidean distance between a centroid and a data point by clicking on the **DISTANCE** button.
6. Click on the **CLUSTER** button to determine the cluster of each data point.
7. Click on the **CENTROIDS** button and compute the new centroid of each cluster.
8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the Old Cluster value and New Cluster value match.
9. If the Old Cluster matches the New Cluster, click on the **NEXT** button and enter the required value in the SSE equation.
10. After finding total SSE click on the **NEXT** button and repeat steps 4 to 9 for K = 2 to 4.
11. Finally, click on the **PLOT** button to display the graph.

#### **Silhouette method**
1. Enter the values of **X and Y** in the attributes section and click on the **ADD** button.
2. Repeat step 1 until there are **5** data-points in the table.
3. Click on the **NEXT** button.
4. Select centroids and click on the **SUBMIT** button.
5. Find the Euclidean distance between a centroid and a data point by clicking on the **DISTANCE** button.
6. Click on the **CLUSTER** button to determine the cluster of each data point.
7. Click on the **CENTROIDS** button and compute the new centroid of each cluster.
8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the Old Cluster value and New Cluster value match.
9. If the Old Cluster matches the New Cluster, click on the **NEXT** button and then click on **COHESION**.
10. Next, click on the **SEPARATION** button.
11. Enter the values for **a(i)** and **b(i)** into the Silhouette coefficient equation from the table, and then click on the **SUBMIT** button.
12. Now, calculate the average Silhouette score by entering all individual Silhouette scores (s(i)) into the equation, and then click on the **SUBMIT** button.
13. Click on the **NEXT** button.
14. Repeat steps 4 to 13 for K = 3, 4, 5.
15. Finally, click on the **PLOT** button to display the graph.
